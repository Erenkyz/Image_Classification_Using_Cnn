# Image_Classification_Using_Cnn

📦 CiFAR-10 Image Classification Using CNNs
This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely-used benchmark in computer vision tasks. The notebook implements a deep learning model to classify images into 10 different categories, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

📚 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of:

60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels

10 classes

50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing

🚀 Project Goals
Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset

Build and train a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluate model performance on the test set

Visualize model predictions and training progress

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

🧠 Model Architecture
A typical CNN architecture used includes:

Convolutional layers

MaxPooling layers

Dropout for regularization

Fully connected (Dense) layers

Softmax activation for classification
